I expect my journey in CMSC 100 to be challenging but also fun, as I expect web programming can be tough but rewarding, especially when taking inspiration from good web apps. I also expect to learn how to make functional web apps and avoid bad web programming practices.

Yanna: Yes, I agree. And I also hope to establish connections with you.
